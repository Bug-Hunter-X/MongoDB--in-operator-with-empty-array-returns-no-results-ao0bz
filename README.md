# MongoDB $in Operator with Empty Array

This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `$in` operator in MongoDB queries with an empty array. The issue is that a query like `db.collection.find({ field: { $in: [] } })` will always return an empty array, even if the `field` exists and has other values. 

This can cause unexpected behavior in applications and is often difficult to debug.

The solution provided in `bugSolution.js` shows how to properly handle this scenario by checking for an empty array and modifying the query accordingly.  This ensures the query behaves as expected when the array is empty, returning documents which match any other criteria.
